# Hi, I'm Duke

## Full Stack Developer

**React** — I build modern UIs with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Vite: SPAs, dashboards, headless CMS frontends, and real-time interfaces. I care about clean components, state management, and scalable frontend architecture.

**AI** — I integrate AI into products: LLM-powered automation, RAG pipelines, chatbots, content generation, and reasoning-based features using OpenAI, LangChain, and vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate). I help teams ship AI that works in production.

I also have a strong **backend** background in Java, PHP, and Golang (Spring Boot, Laravel, Gin, gRPC, microservices)—so full-stack and system design come naturally.

If you're looking for a technical partner who can own React and AI features and architect for scale, I'm open to **ongoing collaboration**.
